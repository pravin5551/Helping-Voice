# Helping-Voice

------------------- INTRODUCTION ----------------------

Helping voice is an Android App which helps blind people's to listen books, podcasts, novels etc.
The app is completely controlled by voice so the user just have to give voice commands such as "search me a podcast about programming" and the app will do it.
Also if user says "it's en emergency", the app automatically calls the mobile number which is registered as emergency contact. 
User can also listen music by just speaking "play me some music".
The app is still under development and any suggestions and recommendations is highly admired.
